# MicroBR
A 20-25 minute battle royale gamemode datapack for Minecraft.

This datapack adds a short gamemode made for gamenights with friends.

This datapack was made in parity to [SamsLootBoxes](https://github.com/Tebsickle/SamsLootBoxes). This pack was made to be used alongside it.

## To Install:
1) Download this repo.
2) Drag the ```microBR``` folder of this repo into the ```datapack``` folder of your server's world.
3) ```/reload``` in your server's console, or in game as ```op```.

That's it!

## To Use:
When in game, use ```/function microbr:game/start``` to start the game.

## TODO

- Add alternative sudden death ending, with lava rising and dragon spawns.

- Balance the size of the worldborder based on player count?
