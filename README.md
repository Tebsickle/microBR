# MicroBR
A 20-25 minute battle royale gamemode datapack for Minecraft.

This datapack adds a short gamemode made for gamenights with friends.

And not to fret, this pack was made well enough so that your friends can't "break the rules". PVP is disabled initially.

Last player standing wins!

This datapack was made in parity to [SamsLootBoxes](https://github.com/Tebsickle/SamsLootBoxes). This pack was made to be used alongside it.

## Details

The following is what happens over the course of the game.

Minute 0: Border expands to 500 blocks over 2 minutes.
Minute 2: Grace period ends. PvP is enabled.
Minute 15: Border begins to shrink to 26 blocks over 5 minutes.
Minute 20: Sudden death begins. All players are given the glowing effect.

Anything that happens after sudden death is for you to find out. :)

## To Install:

### PREREQUISITE
